#todo list for the simple pixel engine

#todo should be done first
-Extend texture atlas to an "animation" class where in it cycles with an animation speed of frames to update through a range in the texture atlas or an subimage/subatlas
-implement a playercontrol map where gl Keycallbacks only change the state ond then are incorperated into rendering so movemtn happens as long as a thing is pressed and multiple buttons can be pressed at once
-implement a camera class that moves the renderd screenspace according to the player position

#todo very optional atm
-implement glsl shader support for 2d shaders
-implement sound?
-implement mouse interactions ?
